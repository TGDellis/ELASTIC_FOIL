# ELASTIC_FOIL
C code that computes the aeroelastic behavior  of 2d airfoil with lumped mass. The foil is able to move in the flap-wise and edgewise directions. Two methods are present.  Quasi-steady analysis, via linearization of the steady aerodynamic polars around equilibrium, and unsteady analysis via an implementation of Theodorsen analysis.
